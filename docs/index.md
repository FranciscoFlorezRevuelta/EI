Regarding the methodology:

- The theory contents should be revised by the student before attending the practical sessions. A test will be answered to ensure that these contents are read and understood by the student. The tests represent 30% of the final grade. 
- Practical assignments (jupyter notebooks) are to be completed as indicated in each assignment description. Each of the course blocks will have one or more practical assignments. The assignments represent 50% of the final grade.
- A report on transversal issues: ethics, data protection, reliability, usability, acceptability ([Work proposals](work_proposals.md)) will be developed in groups representing 20% of the final grade.
