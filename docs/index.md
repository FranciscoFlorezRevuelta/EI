Regarding the methodology:

- The theory contents should be revised by the student before attending the practical sessions. A test will be answered to ensure that these contents are read and understood by the student. The tests represent 30% of the final grade. 
- Practical assignments (jupyter notebooks) are to be completed as indicated in each assignment description. Each of the course blocks will have one or more practical assignments. The assignments represent 40% of the final grade.
- A project ([Project proposals](projects.md)) will be developed in groups representing 30% of the final grade.
